# HumanResoucesManagementSystem

This was a project created by myself and my classmates as part of our Major Project for our Diploma of Software Dev!

The class assignment was to work in an AGILE project environment while incorporating the SCRUM methodology. Iterations were documented using an in-house project management system and code was regularly 'checked in' using Visual Studio's Team Foundation Server.

The application was built using Visual Studio 2013 incorporating Microsoft's ASP.NET MVC 5 with WebApi framework:

On the client side, Kendo's UI was the focus on building a rich user friendly front end, which incorporated JQuery, JavaScript, HTML5 & CSS with Bootstrap.
On the server side, data was being persisted using Entity Framework, Dependency Injection and the Repository Pattern.
My part of focus was on the 'Support / Roster' area of the project, however, I was heavily involved in assisting with other areas of development as well. created by myself and my classmates as part of our Major Project for our Dip of Software Dev!

Since completing the course, I have re-written the UI entirely in Angular (just for shits n giggles) which can be found in the UI - Angular folder.
